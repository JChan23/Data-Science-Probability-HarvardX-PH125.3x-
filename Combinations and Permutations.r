#Exercise 2. Sampling with replacement
#Say youâ€™ve drawn 5 balls from the a box that has 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls, with replacement, and all have been yellow.
#What is the probability that the next one is yellow?

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# Assign the variable 'p_yellow' as the probability that a yellow ball is drawn from the box.
p_yellow <- yellow/(yellow+magenta+cyan)

# Using the variable 'p_yellow', calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball on the sixth draw. Print this value to the console.
p_yellow


#Exercise 3. Rolling a die
#If you roll a 6-sided die once, what is the probability of not seeing a 6? If you roll a 6-sided die six times, what is the probability of not seeing a 6 on any of those rolls?

# Assign the variable 'p_no6' as the probability of not seeing a 6 on a single roll.
p_no6 <- 5/6

# Calculate the probability of not seeing a 6 on six rolls using `p_no6`. Print your result to the console: do not assign it to a variable.
(p_no6)^6


#Exercise 4. Probability the Celtics win a game
#Two teams, say the Celtics and the Cavs, are playing a seven game series. The Cavs are a better team and have a 60% chance of winning each game.
#What is the probability that the Celtics win at least one game? Remember that the Celtics must win one of the first four games, or the series will be over!

# Assign the variable `p_cavs_win4` as the probability that the Cavs will win the first four games of the series.
p_cavs_win4 <- (6/10)^4

# Using the variable `p_cavs_win4`, calculate the probability that the Celtics win at least one game in the first four games of the series.
1-p_cavs_win4


#Exercise 5. Monte Carlo simulation for Celtics winning a game
#Create a Monte Carlo simulation to confirm your answer to the previous problem by estimating how frequently the Celtics win at least 1 of 4 games. Use B <- 10000 simulations.

simulated_games <- sample(c("lose","win"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4))
B <- 10000
set.seed(1)
celtic_wins <- replicate(B, {
    simulated_games <- sample(c("lose","win"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4))
    "win" %in% simulated_games
})
mean(celtic_wins)
